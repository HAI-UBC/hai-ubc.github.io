                    <p align="justify">
                        Our research is at the intersection of AI, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Cognitive
                        Science, with the overarching goal to support Human-AI collaboration via trustworthy AI
                        artifacts that can understand relevant properties of their users (e.g., states, skills, needs)
                        and personalize the interaction accordingly, in a manner that preserves transparency and user
                        control.
                        The AI component of this research investigates how to enable AI agents to infer relevant user
                        properties from usually limited and noisy interaction information and make informed decisions on
                        suitable personalization. The HCI component focuses on devising user-adaptive interaction that
                        abides by usability principles fundamental for user acceptance (e.g., unobtrusiveness,
                        transparency, predictability, and controllability). Finally, the Cognitive Science component
                        provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying the target interactions and helps
                        identify which user characteristics should be modeled for effective adaptation.
