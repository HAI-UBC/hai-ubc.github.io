        <b>Principal Investigators:</b>
<br>

Vedant R Bahel, MSc student, Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia. <br>

Harshinee Sriram, PhD student, Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia. <br>

Dr. Cristina Conati, Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia. <br><br>

<b>Project Purpose and Procedures:</b><br>
This study will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hour. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate Explainable AI (XAI) in an intelligent educational environment. In this study, a variety of methods will be used to record data: questionnaires and tests, computer log files and eye tracking.
You will be asked to study an AI algorithm using the AIspace educational tools and accompanying text-based materials. Your interactions with the educational software will be logged, your eye gaze will be recorded by an eye tracker, and you will be videotaped when using the software. You will be asked to take tests about the concepts you have learned. There will also be a questionnaire and interview at the end of the study.
<br><br>

<b>Requirements</b><br>
To participate in this study, you must meet the following requirements: <br>
1.	Are currently a UBC student majoring in Computer Science (or a related program).<br>
2.	Have taken CPSC 221 or equivalent.<br> 
3.	Have NOT take CPSC 322.<br>
4.	Not have color vision deficiency.<br> 
5.	Be able to participate without glasses.<br> 
<br>

<b>Confidentiality</b><br>
The identities of all people who participate will remain anonymous and will be kept confidential. All data from individual participants will be coded so that their anonymity will be protected in any project reports and presentations that result from this work.  
<br> <br>
<b>Remuneration/Compensation</b><br>
We are very grateful for your participation. We estimate that the study will take approximately 1.5-2hour. At the end of the study, you will receive $20/hr, provided you meet the requirements listed. 
If for some reason during the study the principal investigator judges that your data cannot be used (e.g. if the software does not work correctly), or you choose to withdraw from the study before the study has been completed, you will still be paid $5 per half hour for each half hour or portion of half an hour that was completed, provided you meet the study requirements.  
Students who do not meet all the requirements listed above, cannot participate in this study. In this case, you will not be paid even if all or any portion of the study has already been completed.
